# Reporting  on IoT data

In this part we will make a dashboard that can report on the data from the Beer Blades. Think about metrics like Temperature of the beer keg, the volume of the beer keg, ambient temperature, air pressure etc.

What services in Azure are Used:
- IoT-Hub
- Azure Stream Analytics Job
- SQL DB (SQL-Server)
- ~~PowerBI~~ (PowerBI didn't make the workshop, needed accounts for everybody and realtime was only in paid subscription)
- Grafana (Open Source Dashboard/reporting tool as an alternative for PowerBI)
- Supporting services (like VNET's, storage accounts etc.)
